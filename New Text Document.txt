SWING is for make the FRAME.

setSize() -> for frame size.
setVisible(true) -> used to show the frame.It should be last line of the statement
setLocation() -> to change the location , where the frame is going to open.
setLayout() -> used to set the layout inside the frame.
JPanel -> is for change or add anything in the top of the frame.
setBounds() ->  to pass the coordinates.
p1.add back -> we're adding back on the p1.
We can;t pass i2 directly to the JLable, that;s why we made i3 to pass the i2 instance.
JLable -> used to write anything on the frame.
setUndecorated(true) -> for remove the header of the frame.
JTextField -> where user can write anything 
getText -> to get whatever user is writing in the text field.
BorderLayout -> help to set the element top, bittom, left, right, centre.
verticalBox -> sent output is coming one after one.
BorderLayoutRight LineEnd-> output is coming right side of the frame.
VerticalStrut(15) -> after 15px next output will show
we can add html tags into the string.
text.setText("") -> means after send the msg the text input will be empty.
set.Text() -> for setting any value dynamically.

SOCKET is for make it working together CLIENT and SERVER side both.

inputstream() -> for read the data.
outputstream() -> for send the data.
readUTF() -> for read the data which is in the msg.
WriteUTF() -> for display the data from the msg
when we're adding verticle it's giving erro that we can't add non static method. that's why we make is static.
now we cant extends JFrame. We need to create object of JFrame class. After creating object all the methods we called are giving errors.
So we need to use that using object refference. eg. f.add
